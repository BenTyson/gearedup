      <div class="prose-gearedup">
        <p>
          GearedUp exists because we got tired of sifting through generic "best of" lists that
          clearly hadn't been written by actual hobbyists. When you're looking for the best
          rotary cutter for quilting or the perfect card sleeves for your MTG collection,
          you deserve recommendations from people who actually use this stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's us. We're quilters, board gamers, miniature painters, and crafters. We've made
          the mistakes so you don't have to. We've tested the cheap options and the premium ones.
          And we're here to share what we've learned.

            We create detailed comparison criteria specific to each product type.

            <strong>Full transparency:</strong> GearedUp earns money through affiliate links.
            When you click a link to Amazon or another retailer and make a purchase, we may

            This is how we keep the site running and fund our research. However, it never
            influences our recommendations. We'd rather recommend a product with a lower
            commission (or no commission at all) than steer you toward something subpar.

          <p>
            Every product we recommend is something we'd genuinely suggest to a friend.
            That's the standard we hold ourselves to.
