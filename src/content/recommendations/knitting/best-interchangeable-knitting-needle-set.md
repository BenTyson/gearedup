methodology: |
  <p>We knit multiple projects with each set to evaluate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cable quality:</strong> Are cables flexible without memory coiling?</li>
    <li><strong>Join quality:</strong> Are needle-to-cable connections smooth and snag-free?</li>
    <li><strong>Tip sharpness:</strong> How well do points work for different yarn weights?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Do needles and cables hold up over time?</li>
    <li><strong>Size range:</strong> Does the set cover the sizes you'll actually use?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each set for at least 3 completed projects before forming opinions.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Why buy interchangeable needles instead of fixed circulars?"
    answer: "Interchangeables let you swap tip sizes and cable lengths, so one set replaces dozens of fixed needles. They're more economical long-term and easier to store. The trade-off is the join between tip and cable, which can catch yarn if not properly tightened. Quality sets minimize this issue."

  - question: "What sizes should an interchangeable set include?"
    answer: "Most sets include US 4-11 (3.5mm-8mm), which covers common yarn weights from fingering to bulky. You may need to buy extra tips for very fine lace (US 2 and below) or super bulky yarn (US 13 and up). Check what sizes you use most before buying."

  - question: "ChiaoGoo vs Knitter's Pride - which is better?"
    answer: "ChiaoGoo has superior cables - the red cables are flexible without memory and never coil. Knitter's Pride has slightly rougher cables but offers more variety (wood, metal, acrylic) at lower prices. For pure performance, ChiaoGoo. For variety or budget, Knitter's Pride."

  - question: "Metal vs wood interchangeable needles?"
    answer: "Metal needles are slippery and fast, great for experienced knitters. Wood is warmer, has more grip, and is often preferred by beginners or those with hand issues. Many knitters have both - wood for slippery yarns, metal for sticky ones."

  - question: "Can I mix cables and tips from different brands?"
    answer: "Generally no - each brand has proprietary threading. ChiaoGoo tips only work with ChiaoGoo cables, etc. Some brands (like Knitter's Pride and Knit Picks) share threading and can be mixed. Check compatibility before assuming pieces will work together."

Interchangeable needle sets are the smart way to build your needle collection. Instead of buying dozens of fixed circular needles, you get tips and cables that mix and match.

The key is cable quality. Bad cables coil, snag, and fight you. Good cables disappear - you forget they're there.

**Quick answer:** The [ChiaoGoo TWIST Red Lace set](#product-1) is what experienced knitters recommend. Those cables are worth every penny. For wood needles on a budget, Knitter's Pride Dreamz is excellent.
