methodology: |
  <p>We used each bag type for real-world knitting to evaluate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Yarn management:</strong> Does it keep yarn clean and tangle-free?</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> How easy is it to access your project?</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Is it practical to carry around?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> How does construction hold up?</li>
    <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Are there pockets for notions and tools?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We tested on commutes, in waiting rooms, and during travel to assess real-world usability.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Do I really need a dedicated project bag?"
    answer: "You can use any bag, box, or basket. But purpose-built project bags have features that help: yarn-feeding holes, wide openings, pockets for notions. If you knit away from home regularly, a good project bag makes it easier. If you only knit at home, any container works."

  - question: "What size project bag should I get?"
    answer: "It depends on what you knit. Small bags (sock-sized) work for portable projects. Medium bags handle sweaters and shawls. Large totes carry multiple projects plus supplies. Many knitters have a few sizes for different situations. Start with medium if buying just one."

  - question: "How do I keep yarn from tangling in the bag?"
    answer: "Use a yarn bowl or bag with a yarn-feeding hole - the yarn stays contained while you pull what you need. Alternatively, put your yarn cake in a ziplock bag with just the working end sticking out. Avoid loose skeins; wind yarn into cakes for tangle-free portability."

  - question: "Zipper, drawstring, or open top - which closure is best?"
    answer: "Drawstrings are most popular - they cinch around your needles while you work. Zipper closures are more secure for travel but less convenient for active projects. Open tops are easiest to access but offer less protection. Most knitters prefer drawstring."

  - question: "Should I get waterproof bags?"
    answer: "Water-resistant is nice for rainy commutes or outdoor knitting. Full waterproof isn't usually necessary unless you're knitting at the beach or pool. Most fabric bags can be treated with waterproofing spray if needed."
