methodology: |
  <p>We blocked dozens of projects on each mat type to evaluate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pin hold:</strong> Do pins stay put without sliding or falling out?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> How well does the foam hold up over time?</li>
    <li><strong>Measurement aids:</strong> Are grid lines accurate and visible?</li>
    <li><strong>Size/coverage:</strong> Is there enough space for various projects?</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> How easy is it to store when not in use?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We tested with wet blocking, steam blocking, and spray blocking techniques.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Do I really need blocking mats?"
    answer: "You can block on any flat, pin-able surface - a bed, carpet, or towel on the floor. But blocking mats make it easier: the foam holds pins securely, the grid helps with measurements, and they can be used anywhere. If you block regularly, they're worth it."

  - question: "How many mats do I need?"
    answer: "A 9-pack covers about 36x36 inches - enough for most projects. For large shawls or blankets, you may need more. The interlocking design lets you buy additional packs and combine them. Start with one pack and add more if needed."

  - question: "Can I use exercise mats or gym tiles instead?"
    answer: "Yes! Gym floor tiles are a popular budget alternative. They work fine but typically lack measurement grids and may not hold pins as securely. For casual blocking, they're perfectly adequate. For precise work, dedicated blocking mats are worth the upgrade."

  - question: "What's the difference between wet blocking and steam blocking?"
    answer: "Wet blocking soaks the finished piece, pins it to shape, and lets it dry. It's more aggressive and best for natural fibers. Steam blocking uses an iron or steamer to relax fibers without soaking. Steam is gentler and works better for synthetics. Your fiber content determines which to use."

  - question: "How long does blocking take to dry?"
    answer: "Wet blocked items typically take 24-48 hours to dry completely, depending on thickness and humidity. Don't unpin until fully dry or the item will spring back. A fan speeds up drying. Steam blocked items are ready much faster since they're not wet."

Blocking is the magic step that transforms lumpy, uneven knitting into polished finished objects. Your stitches even out, lacework opens up, and everything looks professional.

You can block on carpet or a bed, but dedicated blocking mats make it easier and more precise.

**Quick answer:** [KnitIQ blocking mats](#product-1) are the standard recommendation. Thick foam, clear grid lines, and they hold pins securely. A 9-pack covers most projects.
