methodology: |
  <p>We tested needles with beginners and experienced knitters across multiple projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Do stitches stay on without being hard to slide?</li>
    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> How do they feel during hour-long sessions?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Do they warp, bend, or splinter?</li>
    <li><strong>Tip precision:</strong> Are the points good for different yarn weights?</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Price relative to quality and longevity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We had beginners use each needle type for their first projects to gauge the learning experience.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size needles should I start with?"
    answer: "Size US 7 or US 8 (4.5-5mm) are ideal for beginners. They're large enough to see your stitches clearly but not so large that tension becomes difficult. Pair them with medium-weight yarn (worsted/aran) for the easiest learning experience."

  - question: "Bamboo vs metal vs plastic - which is best for beginners?"
    answer: "Bamboo is best for most beginners. The slight friction keeps stitches from sliding off while you're learning tension control. Metal needles are slippery - great for speed once you know what you're doing. Plastic is lightweight and affordable but often lower quality."

  - question: "Straight needles vs circular needles for beginners?"
    answer: "Either works! Straight needles (single point) are more intuitive for beginners - you can see exactly where you are. Circular needles are more versatile and better for larger projects. Many knitters eventually switch to circulars for everything, but start with whatever feels natural."

  - question: "How many pairs of needles do I need to start?"
    answer: "Just one pair in size US 7 or 8 to start. Buy needles as patterns require them rather than buying sets upfront. You'll develop preferences for materials and brands, so it's better to build your collection gradually with needles you'll actually use."

  - question: "Do expensive needles make a difference?"
    answer: "Yes, but not for beginners. Premium needles have smoother joins, better tips, and last longer. When you're learning, the difference matters less than practicing technique. Upgrade to quality needles once you know what size and style you prefer."
