methodology: |
  <p>We wound dozens of skeins with each winder to evaluate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cake quality:</strong> Does it make tight, stable cakes that pull from center?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> How do the gears hold up over time?</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Is it intuitive to set up and operate?</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> How much yarn can it handle at once?</li>
    <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Does it stay put while winding?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We tested with yarn weights from lace to bulky across multiple fiber types.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Do I really need a yarn winder?"
    answer: "Not strictly, but it makes life much easier. Yarn winders turn hanks into center-pull cakes that feed smoothly without tangling. If you buy yarn in hanks (from indie dyers or yarn shops), a winder saves hours of frustration. If you only buy yarn already wound into balls, you don't need one."

  - question: "Do I need a yarn swift too?"
    answer: "A swift holds the hank open while you wind. You can technically wind without one (drape the hank over your knees or a chair back), but a swift makes the process much faster and prevents tangles. If you're buying a winder, budget for a swift too."

  - question: "Why do my yarn cakes collapse or tangle?"
    answer: "Usually from winding too loosely or pulling from the wrong end. Wind with consistent, moderate tension. Always pull from the center of the cake, not the outside. If cakes keep collapsing, try winding tighter or using a nostepinne for a different shape."

  - question: "Electric vs manual winder - which should I get?"
    answer: "Manual is fine for most knitters - winding yarn isn't that time-consuming. Electric winders are worth it if you wind a lot of yarn frequently, have repetitive strain issues, or dye your own yarn in large quantities. The price difference is significant."

  - question: "What size yarn winder do I need?"
    answer: "Standard 4oz winders handle most yarn. The jumbo 10oz version is useful for large skeins or bulky yarn, but overkill for sock and fingering weight. Start with the standard size and upgrade only if you regularly work with large skeins."

A yarn winder transforms hanks into neat, center-pull cakes that feed smoothly as you knit. No more tangled messes or yarn barf.

If you buy yarn from local shops or indie dyers (which often comes in hanks), a winder pays for itself in saved frustration.

**Quick answer:** The [Stanwood Needlecraft yarn winder](#product-1) is the workhorse choice at $28. Metal gears mean it'll outlast cheaper plastic alternatives.
