methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated kettles based on what matters for pour-over brewing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pour control:</strong> Can you achieve a slow, steady stream?</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature accuracy:</strong> Does it hit and hold target temps?</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> How fast does it heat water?</li>
    <li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Is it comfortable for 3-4 minute pours?</li>
    <li><strong>Build quality:</strong> Will it last years of daily use?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each kettle for weeks of daily brewing before forming opinions.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Do I really need a gooseneck kettle?"
    answer: "For pour-over, yes. The narrow spout lets you control exactly where water lands and how fast it flows. A regular kettle pours too fast and imprecisely - you'll end up with channeling and uneven extraction. For French press or drip machines, any kettle works."

  - question: "What temperature should I brew coffee at?"
    answer: "195-205°F (90-96°C) for most coffees. Light roasts often benefit from hotter water (200-205°F) while dark roasts do better slightly cooler (195-200°F). Water off the boil (212°F) is too hot and can scorch coffee. Variable temperature kettles let you experiment."

  - question: "Electric vs stovetop gooseneck - which is better?"
    answer: "Electric is more convenient with precise temperature control. Stovetop kettles are cheaper and work anywhere but need a thermometer for accuracy. For daily use at home, electric wins. For travel or induction cooktops, stovetop has its place."

  - question: "Is the Fellow Stagg worth the premium price?"
    answer: "If you're making pour-over daily and care about precision, yes. The build quality, temperature accuracy, and pour control are noticeably better than budget options. If you're making pour-over weekly or casually, a Bonavita or Cosori works great."

  - question: "How important is hold mode/temperature hold?"
    answer: "Very convenient but not essential. Hold mode keeps water at your target temperature for 30-60 minutes, letting you take your time. Without it, you need to reboil or work faster. For morning routines, hold mode is a luxury worth having."

A gooseneck kettle is essential for pour-over coffee. That thin spout gives you control - letting you pour slow and steady, hitting exactly where you want. Regular kettles pour like fire hoses.

Temperature control is the other game-changer. Hitting 200°F instead of boiling makes a real difference in the cup.

**Quick answer:** The [Fellow Stagg EKG](#product-1) is the gold standard at $165. For excellent performance at half the price, the Bonavita is hard to beat.
