methodology: |
  <p>We brewed hundreds of cups across French press styles, evaluating:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Brew quality:</strong> Does it produce rich, full-bodied coffee?</li>
    <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> How much sludge ends up in your cup?</li>
    <li><strong>Heat retention:</strong> How long does coffee stay hot?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Will it survive daily use?</li>
    <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> How easy is maintenance?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We tested each press with the same coffee and technique for fair comparison.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How do I make good French press coffee?"
    answer: "Coarse grind (like sea salt), 1:15 coffee to water ratio, 200°F water. Add coffee, pour water, stir once, wait 4 minutes, press slowly. That's it. Don't press too hard or you'll force fines through the filter. Let the last bit of coffee stay in the press to avoid sludge."

  - question: "Why is my French press coffee bitter or gritty?"
    answer: "Bitter means over-extraction - try a coarser grind or shorter steep. Gritty means too fine a grind or pressing too hard. French press needs a coarse, even grind. If you're using pre-ground coffee, you'll get sludge - it's ground too fine for this method."

  - question: "Glass vs stainless steel French press?"
    answer: "Glass lets you see the brew, is cheaper, but breaks. Stainless steel is unbreakable and insulated but you can't monitor the brew. For most home users, glass is fine. For travel or rough use, go stainless."

  - question: "Is French press coffee bad for you?"
    answer: "French press coffee contains more cafestol, a compound that can raise cholesterol. If you have cholesterol concerns, consider paper-filtered methods. For most people drinking 2-3 cups daily, it's not a significant health concern. Enjoy your coffee."

  - question: "How long should French press steep?"
    answer: "4 minutes is the standard, but you can experiment. Lighter roasts might benefit from 4:30-5 minutes; darker roasts from 3:30-4 minutes. The James Hoffmann method (15+ minutes with no pressing) is worth trying if you want an even cleaner cup."

French press makes rich, full-bodied coffee with almost zero technique required. Ground coffee, hot water, wait, press. It's the simplest path to excellent coffee.

The format hasn't changed in decades because it doesn't need to. A $20 French press makes the same quality coffee as a $40 one - the difference is materials and aesthetics.

**Quick answer:** The [Bodum Chambord](#product-1) is the classic choice at $40. For a budget option that brews identically, the Bodum Brazil is half the price.

Read on for insulated options, premium picks that filter out sludge, and the simple technique for great French press coffee.
