methodology: |
  <p>We brewed dozens of cups with each dripper, testing different beans and techniques:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flavor clarity:</strong> Does the dripper allow the coffee's character to shine?</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Can you replicate good results?</li>
    <li><strong>Forgiveness:</strong> How much does technique affect the final cup?</li>
    <li><strong>Practicality:</strong> Ease of cleaning, filter availability, durability</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Quality of coffee relative to price</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each dripper for at least 20 brews before forming opinions.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Which pour-over is best for beginners?"
    answer: "The Kalita Wave is the most forgiving. Its flat bottom and three-hole design means less technique matters. You'll get good results even with imperfect pours. The V60 makes the best coffee but requires more practice to get right."

  - question: "Does the material (ceramic vs glass vs plastic) matter?"
    answer: "Ceramic and glass retain heat better, which helps extraction. Plastic is lighter and won't break. For best results, preheat your dripper with hot water regardless of material. The material matters less than technique and water temperature."

  - question: "What size pour-over should I get?"
    answer: "Get the medium size (V60 02, Kalita 185, 6-cup Chemex). These handle 1-3 cups comfortably. Too small and you can't make enough; too large and single cups brew poorly. The medium size is the sweet spot."

  - question: "Why do I need special filters?"
    answer: "Filters designed for your dripper fit properly and flow correctly. Generic filters might clog, fold wrong, or flow too fast. The cost difference is negligible - use the right filters. Pro tip: rinse paper filters before brewing to remove paper taste."

  - question: "V60 vs Chemex vs Kalita - which tastes best?"
    answer: "It depends on your preference. V60 produces the brightest, most complex cups. Chemex makes the cleanest, lightest body. Kalita is balanced and forgiving. All make excellent coffee - try the style that matches how you like your coffee."
