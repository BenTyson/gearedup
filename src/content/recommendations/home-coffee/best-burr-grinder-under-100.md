methodology: |
  <p>We tested each grinder by analyzing grind particle distribution and brewing with multiple methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Grind consistency:</strong> How uniform are the particles? Fewer fines = cleaner cup</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> How much ground coffee stays stuck in the grinder?</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Is it intuitive to adjust settings and clean?</li>
    <li><strong>Build quality:</strong> Will it last? Can it be repaired?</li>
    <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Important for early morning brewing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We ground at least 5 lbs of coffee through each grinder before forming opinions.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Why does a burr grinder matter?"
    answer: "Blade grinders smash beans randomly, creating dust and boulders mixed together. This extracts unevenly - you get bitter compounds from the fines and sour notes from the boulders. Burr grinders crush beans between two surfaces for consistent particle size, which extracts evenly for a cleaner, more flavorful cup."

  - question: "Can I use a cheap grinder for espresso?"
    answer: "Entry-level burr grinders ($100 and under) struggle with espresso's fine grind requirements. They don't adjust finely enough, and consistency suffers at fine settings. For true espresso, budget at least $200-300 for a capable grinder. These grinders work great for pour-over, French press, and drip."

  - question: "Conical vs flat burrs - what's the difference?"
    answer: "At this price range, it doesn't matter much. Conical burrs are more common in home grinders - they run cooler, retain less grounds, and are quieter. Flat burrs are typically found in higher-end commercial grinders. Focus on grind consistency, not burr shape."

  - question: "How much should I expect to spend on a grinder?"
    answer: "For pour-over and drip: $70-150 gets excellent results. For espresso: $200-400 minimum. The grinder is often more important than the brewer - it's where your coffee budget should go first. A great grinder with a $20 pour-over beats a cheap grinder with expensive equipment."

  - question: "Manual vs electric grinder - which should I choose?"
    answer: "Manual grinders like the Timemore C2 offer better grind quality per dollar because you're not paying for a motor. But hand-grinding takes 30-60 seconds per cup. If you make multiple cups daily or value convenience, go electric. If you make one cup and enjoy the ritual, manual wins."

Your grinder is the most important piece of coffee equipment you'll buy. It determines extraction more than any brewing method. A cheap grinder makes expensive beans taste mediocre. A good grinder makes average beans shine.

The good news? You don't need to spend $500 to get great results at home.

**Quick answer:** The [Baratza Encore ESP](#product-1) is the gold standard at $99. It's the grinder coffee professionals recommend to beginners, and the one most people never need to upgrade from.

Read on for budget alternatives, manual grinder options, and why you should spend on your grinder before your brewer.
