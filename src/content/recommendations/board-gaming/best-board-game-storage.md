methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated storage solutions based on board gamer needs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cube dimensions:</strong> Do standard game boxes fit?</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> How many games per dollar?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Can it handle heavy games without sagging?</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Easy to grab games for game night?</li>
    <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Does it look good in a living space?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We focused on solutions that work for collections of 20+ games, where dedicated storage becomes necessary.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Should I store board games vertically or horizontally?"
    answer: "Horizontally is generally better—it prevents component shifting and box damage. Vertical storage is fine for games with good inserts or baggied components. Never store heavy games on top of lighter boxes."

  - question: "How do I organize a large board game collection?"
    answer: "Common methods: alphabetical, by game type/mechanic, by player count, by play frequency. Many collectors put favorites at eye level and rarely-played games up high. Whatever system you choose, consistency matters more than the specific method."

  - question: "Will KALLAX shelves hold heavy board games?"
    answer: "Yes, but wall-mount the unit to prevent tipping. The 4x4 KALLAX can hold significant weight if mounted properly. Avoid putting all your heaviest games on one shelf—distribute weight evenly across the unit."

  - question: "How do I protect board games from humidity and sunlight?"
    answer: "Keep games away from windows (UV fades boxes), out of basements without climate control (humidity warps components), and away from heating vents (extreme temperature swings). A climate-controlled living area is ideal."

  - question: "Are board game inserts worth the money?"
    answer: "For games you play frequently, absolutely. Inserts like Folded Space cut setup time dramatically and protect components. For games you play once a year, basic bags work fine. Prioritize inserts for complex games with many components."

A growing board game collection needs a storage solution that's both functional and attractive. Games stuffed in closets don't get played.

**Quick answer:** [IKEA KALLAX](#product-1) is the community standard. The 13" cubes fit most games, it's affordable, and you can expand infinitely. If IKEA isn't accessible, [Closetmaid](#product-3) is a solid alternative.
