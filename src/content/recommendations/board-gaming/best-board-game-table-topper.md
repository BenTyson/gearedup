  <p>We evaluated table toppers based on what matters for board gaming:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Surface:</strong> Easy card pickup, component grip, dice control</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Covers common table sizes</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Rolls or folds without damage?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Holds up to regular use?</li>
    <li><strong>Table protection:</strong> Protects from scratches and spills</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We focused on portable toppers, not built-in game table surfaces.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size table topper do I need?"
    answer: "Measure your table and go slightly smaller to prevent overhang. 3x5 ft covers most dining tables (seats 4-6). 4x6 ft works for large tables or seating 6-8. Square tables (4x4 ft) work well for most board games."

  - question: "Neoprene vs felt—which is better for board games?"
    answer: "Neoprene is better overall: better grip, easier card pickup, more durable, and spill-resistant. Felt is cheaper and gives a classic casino feel but wears faster and cards slide more. Go neoprene unless you're primarily playing poker."

  - question: "How do I store a large table topper?"
    answer: "Roll it loosely (not tight) with the play surface facing out to prevent curling. Store horizontally or use a large tube. Never fold neoprene mats—creases are permanent. Most come with a carrying bag or tube."

  - question: "How do I clean a gaming table topper?"
    answer: "Wipe neoprene with a damp cloth and mild soap. Never machine wash or use harsh chemicals. For stubborn stains, a soft brush works. Air dry completely before rolling up to prevent mildew."

  - question: "Is a table topper worth it vs a gaming table?"
    answer: "For most people, yes. A good topper ($50-100) gives you 80% of the gaming table experience for 5% of the cost. Dedicated gaming tables are great but cost $1,000-5,000+. Start with a topper and upgrade later if you want."
