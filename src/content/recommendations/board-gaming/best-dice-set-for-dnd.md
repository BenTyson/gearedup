methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated dice sets based on what TTRPG players need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Do they roll randomly? (No loaded dice)</li>
    <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Can you read the numbers quickly?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Will they survive years of rolling?</li>
    <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Do they look good on the table?</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> What do you get for the price?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We focused on standard 7-piece polyhedral sets (d4, d6, d8, d10, d%, d12, d20).</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What dice do you need for D&D?"
    answer: "A standard 7-piece polyhedral set: d4, d6, d8, d10, d% (percentile), d12, and d20. The d20 is used most often (attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks). Some classes need extra d6s for damage (rogues, fireballs), so having extras is nice."

  - question: "Are metal dice fair?"
    answer: "Quality metal dice from reputable brands (Norse Foundry, Die Hard Dice) are balanced and fair. Cheap metal dice may have voids or imbalances. The weight doesn't affect fairness—they just feel different and make a satisfying sound."

  - question: "How many dice sets should I have?"
    answer: "One set works for starting. Most players eventually collect 3-5 sets they rotate based on mood or character. DMs often want extras on hand for players who forget theirs. There's no wrong answer—dice collecting is half the hobby."

  - question: "Do I need a dice tray?"
    answer: "With plastic dice, it's optional. With metal dice, absolutely yes—they'll damage wood tables and floors. Dice trays also keep rolls contained, which is nice for crowded tables. A simple $10-15 tray works fine."

  - question: "What are the best dice for beginners?"
    answer: "Chessex sets are ideal: affordable, high quality, available everywhere, and come in colors you'll love. Start with one set that matches your character concept. You'll inevitably buy more once you see all the options."
