methodology: |
  <p>We've collectively sleeved thousands of Magic cards and shuffled millions of times. Our evaluation focused on what matters for actual gameplay:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shuffle feel:</strong> How smoothly do the sleeves glide during riffle and mash shuffles?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> How long before sleeves split, cloud, or lose their snap?</li>
    <li><strong>Fit:</strong> Do cards sit securely without being too tight or loose?</li>
    <li><strong>Opacity:</strong> Can you see through the back? (Important for tournament play)</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Cost per sleeve considering how long they last</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We tested each sleeve type with at least 50 hours of gameplay before making our recommendations.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How many sleeves do I need for an MTG deck?"
    answer: "For a 60-card constructed deck, buy a pack of 80-100 sleeves (extras for double-sleeving or replacements). For Commander, you need 100 sleeves minimum, but 120 gives you spares. Most packs come in quantities of 50, 80, or 100."

  - question: "Should I double-sleeve my expensive cards?"
    answer: "Yes, double-sleeving is highly recommended for expensive cards and competitive decks. Use perfect fit inner sleeves plus outer sleeves. This protects against liquid spills and adds rigidity. For a casual $20 deck, single sleeving is fine."

  - question: "How often should I replace card sleeves?"
    answer: "Replace sleeves when they start splitting, become sticky, lose their snap during shuffling, or begin to cloud. For heavy play, this might be every 3-6 months. For casual Commander that you play weekly, sleeves can last years."

  - question: "Matte or glossy sleeves - which is better?"
    answer: "It's personal preference. Matte sleeves shuffle slightly better and reduce glare, but can dull card art. Glossy sleeves show off art better but may stick together in humid conditions. Most competitive players prefer matte."

  - question: "Can I mix sleeve brands in a deck?"
    answer: "Technically yes, but it's not recommended for tournament play. Judges may consider mixed sleeves as marked cards since different brands have slightly different backs, thickness, and wear patterns. Keep your deck uniform."

Whether you're protecting a $500 Modern deck or your favorite Commander build, the right sleeves make a huge difference. Bad sleeves split during shuffling, stick together in humidity, or wear out after a few games.

Good sleeves? They shuffle like butter, last for years, and keep your cards pristine.

**Quick answer:** [Ultra Pro Eclipse](#product-1) sleeves are our top pick for most players. They nail the balance of quality, durability, and price at around $10 for 80 sleeves.
