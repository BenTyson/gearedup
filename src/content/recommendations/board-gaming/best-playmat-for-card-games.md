methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated playmats based on what card players actually need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Surface quality:</strong> Does it allow smooth card sliding?</li>
    <li><strong>Anti-slip:</strong> Does it stay put during play?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Stitched edges? Washable?</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Standard 24x14" for card games</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Rolls up without damage?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We focused on standard-size mats for TCG play (MTG, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc.).</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size playmat do I need for Magic: The Gathering?"
    answer: "Standard 24x14 inches works for most players. This fits your play area comfortably with room for library, graveyard, and exile. Larger mats (36x18) are available for two-player or commander games where you need more space."

  - question: "How do I clean a playmat?"
    answer: "Most neoprene mats can be hand washed with mild soap and cold water. Some (like Ultimate Guard XenoSkin) are machine washable on gentle. Never use hot water or put in dryer—air dry flat. Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the printing or rubber."

  - question: "Rubber vs fabric playmat—which is better?"
    answer: "Rubber-backed neoprene is the standard for a reason: it stays put, cushions cards, and lasts. Pure fabric mats slide around and offer less protection. Cloth-topped neoprene combines the best of both."

  - question: "Are custom playmats worth it?"
    answer: "If you want unique artwork that expresses your style, absolutely. Inked Gaming and similar services produce high-quality custom mats. Just be mindful of copyright if using fan art or game assets."

  - question: "How do I transport a playmat?"
    answer: "Roll it with the play surface facing out (prevents curling). Use a playmat tube for protection—most are $5-10 and prevent crushing in bags. Don't fold playmats; creases are permanent."
