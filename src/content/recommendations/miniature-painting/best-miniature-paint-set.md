methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated paint sets based on what new painters actually need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Color selection:</strong> Does the set cover the basics for multiple projects?</li>
    <li><strong>Paint quality:</strong> Good coverage, smooth application, consistent formula?</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Cost per color considering the paint quality</li>
    <li><strong>Bottle design:</strong> Droppers vs pots, ease of use, paint preservation</li>
    <li><strong>Expandability:</strong> Can you easily add colors later?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each paint line for complete painting projects before making recommendations.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Citadel vs Vallejo vs Army Painter - which is best?"
    answer: "All three are good, with different strengths. Citadel has the best tutorials and matches GW art. Vallejo has the most consistent quality and best dropper bottles. Army Painter offers the best value. For beginners, Army Painter's value makes it easy to have colors for any project."

  - question: "How many colors do I actually need to start?"
    answer: "You can paint anything with 6-10 colors by mixing. But mixing takes time and skill. For beginners, 20-30 colors lets you paint without constant mixing. 50+ colors means you'll always have the right shade ready. More colors = faster painting but higher upfront cost."

  - question: "Do I need washes and shades?"
    answer: "Yes! Washes are the easiest way to add depth and shadow to miniatures. One coat of wash can make a mediocre paint job look good. Make sure your starter set includes at least black and brown washes, or buy them separately."

  - question: "What's the difference between base, layer, and contrast paints?"
    answer: "Base paints are thick for good coverage over primer. Layer paints are thinner for building up highlights. Contrast paints do both jobs at once but require specific technique. Beginners should start with regular base/layer paints to learn fundamentals."

  - question: "Should I thin my paints?"
    answer: "Yes, always. The saying is 'thin your paints' for a reason. Thick paint obscures detail and leaves brush strokes. Thin paint goes on smoother and builds up naturally. Add water or medium until the paint flows off your brush like milk, not toothpaste."
