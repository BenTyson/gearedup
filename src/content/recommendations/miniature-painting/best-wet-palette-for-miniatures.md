methodology: |
  <p>We tested wet palettes across multiple painting sessions of varying lengths. Our evaluation focused on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> How long do paints stay workable?</li>
    <li><strong>Seal quality:</strong> Can you close it overnight and resume the next day?</li>
    <li><strong>Working surface:</strong> Is there enough room to mix colors?</li>
    <li><strong>Paper quality:</strong> Does it over-hydrate or dry out too fast?</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> How easy is it to keep clean and mold-free?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each palette for at least 20 hours of painting time before reaching conclusions.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What is a wet palette and why do I need one?"
    answer: "A wet palette keeps acrylic paints workable much longer by providing moisture from below through special paper. Without one, mini paints dry in minutes. With a wet palette, paint stays usable for hours - or days if you close the lid. It's a game-changer for miniature painting."

  - question: "Can I make a DIY wet palette?"
    answer: "Yes! Use a shallow container, a damp sponge or paper towels, and parchment paper (not wax paper). It works but has downsides: parchment paper can over-hydrate paints, there's no seal for overnight storage, and you'll fight mold more often. Fine to start, but upgrade eventually."

  - question: "How do I prevent mold in my wet palette?"
    answer: "Add a drop of mold inhibitor or isopropyl alcohol to the water. Don't leave it sealed for more than a few days without refreshing. Clean the sponge weekly. Let it dry completely between extended breaks. Mold loves warm, wet, dark conditions - don't give it that."

  - question: "My paints are too thin on the wet palette - what's wrong?"
    answer: "Too much water is wicking through the paper. Solutions: use thicker hydration paper, reduce water in the sponge, or let the palette sit open for a few minutes before use. Some paints (like washes) are too thin for wet palettes anyway."

  - question: "How often should I change the palette paper?"
    answer: "Change paper when it gets too crowded with dried paint, when colors start mixing into each other, or when you notice mold. For regular painters, that's usually weekly. Some painters use a fresh sheet for each major project."
