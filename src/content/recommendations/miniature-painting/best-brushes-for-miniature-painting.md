methodology: |
  <p>We've painted hundreds of miniatures with dozens of brush brands. Our testing focused on what matters for tabletop painting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Point retention:</strong> Can it maintain a fine tip for detail work?</li>
    <li><strong>Belly capacity:</strong> How much paint does it hold before needing to reload?</li>
    <li><strong>Snap:</strong> Does the brush spring back to shape after each stroke?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> How long before the brush needs replacement?</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Price versus lifespan and performance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each brush for basecoating, layering, and detail work on both infantry and larger models.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size brush should I start with?"
    answer: "Size 1 is the most versatile. Despite looking 'big' compared to tiny detail brushes, a quality size 1 with a good point will handle everything from basecoats to fine details. The larger belly holds more paint, reducing reload time. Size 0 or 00 are only needed for the tiniest details like eyes."

  - question: "Kolinsky sable vs synthetic - what's the difference?"
    answer: "Kolinsky sable brushes hold more paint, maintain their point longer, and have better 'snap' that returns them to shape. Synthetic brushes are cheaper and better for rough techniques like drybrushing (which destroys any brush). Start with synthetics to learn, upgrade to sable when you're ready."

  - question: "How do I make brushes last longer?"
    answer: "Never let paint dry in the bristles. Don't dip past the ferrule (metal part). Clean brushes thoroughly after each session. Use brush soap monthly. Store bristles-up or flat, never bristles-down. A $20 sable brush can last years with proper care."

  - question: "Are Games Workshop brushes worth it?"
    answer: "GW brushes are fine but overpriced for what you get. Their synthetic line is decent for beginners, but you'll find better value with Army Painter or Artis Opus. For sable brushes, go straight to Winsor & Newton or Raphael instead of GW's artificer brushes."

  - question: "How many brushes do I need to start?"
    answer: "You can start with just 2-3 brushes: a size 1 for most work, a cheap large brush for basecoats, and an old brush for drybrushing. As you progress, add a small detail brush and dedicated brushes for specific techniques. Quality over quantity."

Your brush is the most important tool in miniature painting. A good brush lets you place paint exactly where you want it, while a bad one fights you every stroke.

The secret? You don't need dozens of brushes or tiny "detail" sizes. **One quality size 1 brush with a good point will handle 90% of your painting.**

**Quick answer:** The [Winsor & Newton Series 7](#product-1) is the industry standard for a reason. At around $18 for a size 1, it's an investment that pays off in paint control and longevity.
