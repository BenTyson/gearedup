methodology: |
  <p>We tested lamps during extended painting sessions, focusing on what matters for detailed hobby work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Is it bright enough to see fine detail without eye strain?</li>
    <li><strong>Color temperature:</strong> Does it render colors accurately (daylight ~5000K)?</li>
    <li><strong>Magnification:</strong> Is the lens useful without distortion at edges?</li>
    <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Can you aim the light exactly where needed?</li>
    <li><strong>Eye comfort:</strong> Can you paint for hours without fatigue?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each lamp for 10+ hour painting sessions before making recommendations.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Do I really need magnification for miniature painting?"
    answer: "It depends on your eyes and the scale you paint. Many painters use good lighting without magnification and do fine. However, if you paint a lot of eyes, freehand designs, or 6mm-15mm scale minis, magnification helps significantly. Try good lighting first, add magnification if you find yourself squinting."

  - question: "What color temperature is best for painting?"
    answer: "Daylight temperature (5000-5500K) is ideal because it shows colors accurately. Warm yellow light makes colors look different than they'll appear in normal lighting. Your lamp should be close to natural daylight so what you paint is what you get."

  - question: "How many lumens do I need?"
    answer: "More is generally better for detail work. 1000 lumens is the minimum for comfortable painting. 2000+ lumens is ideal, especially if you're over 40 or paint small scales. You can always dim a bright light, but you can't brighten a dim one."

  - question: "What magnification power should I get?"
    answer: "2.25x to 3x is the sweet spot for miniatures. Higher magnification (5x-10x) has a very short focal length, meaning you have to hold the mini uncomfortably close. 3x gives you working distance while still enlarging detail significantly."

  - question: "Clip-on magnifier or lamp with built-in magnification?"
    answer: "Built-in magnification lamps are more stable and position easier. Clip-on magnifiers (like optivisors) can be cheaper and work with any light, but some people find them uncomfortable for long sessions. Try both if you can - it's personal preference."

Good lighting is non-negotiable for miniature painting. You can't paint what you can't see, and the wrong light makes colors lie to you.

Add magnification and you'll spot details you've been missing - and catch mistakes before they dry.

**Quick answer:** The [Neatfi XL](#product-1) is our top pick. At 2,200 lumens with a quality magnifying lens, it's the lamp serious hobbyists swear by.
