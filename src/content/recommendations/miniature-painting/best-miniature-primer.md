methodology: |
  <p>We've primed thousands of miniatures in varying conditions. Our testing focused on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adhesion:</strong> Does paint stick without chipping during handling?</li>
    <li><strong>Detail preservation:</strong> Does it obscure fine detail?</li>
    <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> How evenly does it coat complex shapes?</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> How forgiving is the application?</li>
    <li><strong>Dry time:</strong> How quickly can you start painting?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We tested each primer on plastic, resin, and metal miniatures across multiple temperature and humidity conditions.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Grey, black, or white primer - which should I use?"
    answer: "Grey is the most versatile - it works under any color scheme. Black is best for dark, grim models or metallic-heavy schemes. White makes colors pop brighter but shows every missed spot. When in doubt, go grey."

  - question: "Can I prime in cold or humid weather?"
    answer: "Spray primers need 50-80°F (10-27°C) and low humidity. Too cold and the propellant fails. Too humid and you get a fuzzy texture. If weather is bad, use brush-on primer like Vallejo or wait for better conditions."

  - question: "How thin should primer coats be?"
    answer: "Multiple thin coats are always better than one thick coat. You should still see some plastic color through the first coat. Two light passes beat one heavy pass every time. Thick primer fills in detail."

  - question: "Can I use hardware store primer on miniatures?"
    answer: "Automotive primers like Rustoleum 2X work fine and are much cheaper. The key is testing on a spare model first. Some hardware store primers are too thick or have texture that obscures detail. Stick to flat/matte finishes."

  - question: "Do I need to prime resin differently than plastic?"
    answer: "Yes. Wash resin with soap and water first to remove mold release agent. Some primers adhere better to resin than others - Stynylrez and Vallejo are particularly good. Always do a test model with resin."

Primer is the foundation of every paint job. Skip it, and your paint will chip off with the first touch. Apply it wrong, and you'll bury all that beautiful detail.

The right primer grips the plastic, creates a surface paint sticks to, and disappears under your basecoat.

**Quick answer:** [Vallejo Surface Primer](#product-1) is our top choice for its versatility. It works through an airbrush or brush, never obscures detail, and the grey works under any color scheme.
