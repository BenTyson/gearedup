methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated quilting ruler sets based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Are measurements precise and consistent?</li>
    <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Does it stay put during cutting?</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Can you see lines on both light and dark fabric?</li>
    <li><strong>Size variety:</strong> Does the set cover common needs?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Will it last through years of use?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A basic set should include at least a 6x24" rectangle and a square ruler (4.5" or 6.5").</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size quilting rulers do I actually need?"
    answer: "Start with a 6x24\" ruler for cutting strips and a 6.5\" square for trimming blocks. Add a 12.5\" square for larger blocks and a 6x12\" for portability. These four sizes handle 95% of quilting projects. Add specialty rulers (triangles, curves) as needed for specific patterns."

  - question: "Why do quilting rulers slip?"
    answer: "Smooth acrylic on smooth fabric equals sliding. Solutions: Add grip dots or sandpaper circles to the bottom, use rulers with built-in grip (Creative Grids), or apply steady downward pressure with spread fingers. Never press on just one spot."

  - question: "Are expensive quilting rulers worth it?"
    answer: "Yes, for the grip alone. Creative Grids' non-slip feature prevents the slipping that causes crooked cuts and blade injuries. The time saved and frustration avoided make premium rulers worth the investment for regular quilters."

  - question: "How do I store quilting rulers?"
    answer: "Store flat or vertically in a rack—never stacked under heavy objects. Avoid extreme temperatures that can warp acrylic. A wall-mounted ruler rack keeps them organized and prevents scratching from sliding against each other."

  - question: "Can I use a regular ruler for quilting?"
    answer: "No. Quilting rulers are thicker (usually 1/8\") to guide rotary cutters safely, have accurate 1/8\" markings essential for piecing, and won't shatter if you accidentally cut into them. Never use thin plastic or metal rulers with a rotary cutter."

Accurate rulers are the foundation of precise quilting. Bad rulers mean bad cuts, which mean blocks that don't line up—and that frustration compounds with every piece.

**Quick answer:** [Creative Grids rulers](#product-1) are worth the investment. Their built-in non-slip grip eliminates the slipping that causes bad cuts. On a budget? The [ARTEZA set](#product-3) is surprisingly good for $22.
