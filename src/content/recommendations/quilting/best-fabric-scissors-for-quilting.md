methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated fabric scissors based on what matters for quilting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sharpness:</strong> Clean cuts through cotton without fraying</li>
    <li><strong>Edge retention:</strong> How long does the blade stay sharp?</li>
    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Can you use them for extended cutting sessions?</li>
    <li><strong>Precision:</strong> How well do they handle curves and details?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Can they be sharpened and maintained?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We focused on 8-inch shears as the most versatile size for quilters.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size scissors are best for quilting?"
    answer: "8-inch shears are the most versatile for quilting. They're long enough for cutting fabric but precise enough for detail work. 10-inch shears are better for cutting yardage; 4-5 inch scissors are good for thread trimming."

  - question: "How often should I sharpen fabric scissors?"
    answer: "With regular use, sharpen annually. Signs you need sharpening: fabric folds instead of cuts cleanly, scissors pull threads, or you're pressing harder than usual. Never cut paper, plastic, or anything other than fabric with your good scissors."

  - question: "Why are fabric scissors so expensive?"
    answer: "Quality fabric scissors use harder steel that holds an edge longer, are ground to precise angles for fabric cutting, and are manufactured to tighter tolerances. They'll last decades with proper care, making them cheaper long-term than replacing dull budget scissors repeatedly."

  - question: "Left-handed quilter scissors—what should I look for?"
    answer: "True left-handed scissors have the blade reversed so you can see your cutting line. Kai, Gingher, and Fiskars all make left-handed versions. Avoid 'ambidextrous' scissors—they're a compromise that doesn't work well for either hand."

  - question: "Do I need scissors if I have a rotary cutter?"
    answer: "Yes! Rotary cutters are for straight cuts on a mat. Scissors are essential for curves, appliqué, trimming seams, cutting thread, and detailed work. Most quilters use both regularly."
---

While rotary cutters get most of the attention, every quilter needs a good pair of fabric scissors. They're essential for curves, appliqué, trimming, and the countless cuts a rotary can't handle.

**Quick answer:** The [Kai 7250](#product-1) is the best fabric scissors you can buy. If that's above your budget, the [Fiskars RazorEdge](#product-3) is an excellent starter pair at $18.

The difference between cheap and quality scissors becomes obvious the first time you cut—no tugging, fraying, or hand fatigue.
