methodology: |
  <p>We spent 20+ hours researching rotary cutters, reading through quilting forums, Reddit discussions, and hundreds of reviews. Our criteria focused on what actually matters for beginners:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Blade sharpness:</strong> How cleanly does it cut through multiple layers of fabric?</li>
    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Can you use it for extended sessions without hand fatigue?</li>
    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> How reliable and intuitive is the blade guard?</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Is blade changing straightforward?</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Does the quality justify the price?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We deliberately avoided recommending specialty cutters (28mm for curves, 60mm for thick materials) since beginners should master the standard 45mm size first.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size rotary cutter should a beginner get?"
    answer: "45mm is the standard size and best for beginners. It handles most fabrics well, works with standard cutting mats, and replacement blades are widely available and affordable. Once you're comfortable, you might add a 28mm for curves or 60mm for thick materials."

  - question: "How often should I replace rotary cutter blades?"
    answer: "Replace blades when you notice dragging, skipping, or when you need extra pressure to cut through fabric. For regular quilters, this typically means every 8-12 projects. A dull blade is more dangerous than a sharp one because you'll press harder and risk slipping."

  - question: "Are rotary cutters dangerous?"
    answer: "Yes, rotary cutters are extremely sharp and require careful handling. Always engage the safety lock when not actively cutting, cut away from your body, use a proper cutting mat, and keep cutters out of reach of children. With proper technique, they're safe to use."

  - question: "Can I use a rotary cutter without a cutting mat?"
    answer: "No, always use a self-healing cutting mat. It protects your work surface, extends blade life significantly, and provides measurement guides for accurate cuts. Never cut on bare tables, cardboard, or other surfaces."

  - question: "Why do quilters prefer rotary cutters over scissors?"
    answer: "Rotary cutters are faster (cut multiple layers at once), more accurate (use with rulers for perfectly straight lines), and less tiring for large projects. They're essential for precision piecing. Scissors still have their place for detail work and trimming threads."
