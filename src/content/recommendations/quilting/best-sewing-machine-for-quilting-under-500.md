methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated machines based on what quilters actually need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Throat space:</strong> More room = easier to maneuver quilts</li>
    <li><strong>Stitch options:</strong> Walking foot compatibility, decorative stitches</li>
    <li><strong>Motor power:</strong> Can it handle multiple thick layers?</li>
    <li><strong>Extension table:</strong> Included or available for large projects</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Brand reputation and user reviews</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We focused on machines between $150-500 that can handle the demands of quilting beyond basic garment sewing.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What features do I need in a quilting sewing machine?"
    answer: "Look for: a walking foot (often sold separately), extension table for supporting large quilts, adjustable presser foot pressure, drop feed dogs for free-motion quilting, and enough throat space (distance from needle to machine body) to maneuver your quilts. A 1/4\" quilting foot is also essential."

  - question: "Is a mechanical or computerized machine better for quilting?"
    answer: "Both work well. Mechanical machines (like Janome HD3000) are more durable and handle thick layers better. Computerized machines (like Brother CS7000X) offer more stitches and convenience features. Beginners often prefer computerized; experienced quilters often prefer mechanical."

  - question: "What's the difference between a sewing machine and a quilting machine?"
    answer: "Quilting-specific machines have larger throat space, higher sewing speed, extension tables, and features like a built-in walking foot or stitch regulator for free-motion quilting. Under $500, you're getting a sewing machine that's good for quilting, not a dedicated quilting machine."

  - question: "How much should I spend on my first quilting machine?"
    answer: "Spend $200-300 for a good starter machine like the Brother CS7000X. This price range gets you reliable performance and features without overspending before you know your preferences. Budget machines under $150 often frustrate quilters with limitations."

  - question: "Can I quilt with any sewing machine?"
    answer: "You can piece quilt tops with almost any machine. But quilting through all three layers (top, batting, backing) requires a machine with adequate power and a walking foot. Very basic machines often struggle with this and cause puckering."

A good sewing machine transforms quilting from frustrating to fun. But spending $500+ isn't necessary—there are excellent options under that budget.

**Quick answer:** The [Brother CS7000X](#product-1) at around $250 is the sweet spot for most quilters. It has the features you need, an extension table included, and exceptional reliability. For heavy-duty work, upgrade to the [Janome HD3000](#product-2).

Here's what to look for and our top picks at every price point.
