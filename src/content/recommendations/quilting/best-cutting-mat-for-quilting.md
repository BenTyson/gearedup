methodology: |
  <p>We evaluated cutting mats based on what actually matters to quilters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Self-healing quality:</strong> How well does it recover from cuts over time?</li>
    <li><strong>Grid accuracy:</strong> Are the measurements precise and easy to read?</li>
    <li><strong>Size options:</strong> What sizes are available for different spaces?</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> How long will it last with regular use?</li>
    <li><strong>Blade preservation:</strong> Does it extend or shorten blade life?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We focused on mats 18x24" and larger since smaller mats are too limiting for most quilting projects.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "What size cutting mat should I get for quilting?"
    answer: "A 24x36 mat is ideal for most quilters—large enough for cutting yardage but still fits on a standard table. If you're limited on space, an 18x24 works for smaller projects. Only go larger (36x48) if you have dedicated table space and regularly make large quilts."

  - question: "How do I care for a self-healing cutting mat?"
    answer: "Keep it flat and away from direct sunlight and heat (don't leave in a hot car). Clean occasionally with mild soap and water. Never use household cleaners or solvents. If it warps, lay it flat under heavy books for a few days. Rotate which side you use to extend its life."

  - question: "Why is my cutting mat sticky?"
    answer: "Residue from fabric sizing, interfacing, or adhesive from fusible products can build up. Clean with a plastic scraper and mild soapy water. Avoid pressing with a hot iron on your mat—that's often the culprit."

  - question: "How long should a cutting mat last?"
    answer: "A quality mat like OLFA or Fiskars should last 5-10 years with regular use. Budget mats may show wear within 1-2 years. Signs it's time to replace: deep grooves that catch your blade, warping that won't flatten, or faded/unreadable grid lines."

  - question: "Can I use any cutting mat for quilting?"
    answer: "Use a self-healing mat designed for rotary cutting. Craft cutting mats or glass mats will dull your blade quickly and don't provide the grip needed for precise fabric cutting. Look for mats labeled for rotary cutting or quilting specifically."
