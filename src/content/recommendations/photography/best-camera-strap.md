methodology: |
  <p>We carried cameras all day with each strap to evaluate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> How does it feel after hours of use?</li>
    <li><strong>Adjustment:</strong> Can you change length on the fly?</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> How confident are you the camera won't fall?</li>
    <li><strong>Access speed:</strong> How quickly can you get shooting?</li>
    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Does it work in different carry styles?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We tested with mirrorless and DSLR bodies of various weights.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Neck strap vs sling strap vs wrist strap?"
    answer: "Neck straps are versatile but can hurt your neck with heavy gear. Sling straps cross your body and keep the camera at hip level. Wrist straps are minimal but only secure one hand. Match your strap to how you actually carry your camera."

  - question: "Is the stock strap that came with my camera good enough?"
    answer: "Stock straps are usually thin nylon with big brand logos. They work but aren't comfortable for extended use or heavy cameras. Upgrading to a padded strap or a quick-adjust system significantly improves the experience."

  - question: "What's the Peak Design anchor system?"
    answer: "Peak Design's anchors are small loops that attach to your camera's strap lugs. Straps connect and disconnect from anchors instantly. This lets you quickly remove the strap when using a tripod or swap between different straps. The system has become an industry standard."

  - question: "Do I need a quick-release strap system?"
    answer: "Not need, but it's convenient. Quick-release lets you remove the strap for tripod use, storage, or switching carry methods. Once you try it, you won't go back to straps that are always attached."

  - question: "What about hand straps that attach to the camera grip?"
    answer: "Hand straps (also called grip straps) are great for secure one-handed shooting, especially with larger lenses. They're often used with a wrist strap as backup. Popular for wildlife and sports where you're holding the camera ready for long periods."

The strap your camera came with is functional but uncomfortable. After a few hours of shooting, your neck hurts, the thin nylon digs in, and you start leaving the camera in the bag.

A good strap solves this. It distributes weight comfortably and keeps your camera accessible.

**Quick answer:** The [Peak Design Slide](#product-1) is the modern standard at $65. The quick-adjust lets you go from hip-slung to shooting instantly. The anchor system lets you remove the strap for tripod work.
