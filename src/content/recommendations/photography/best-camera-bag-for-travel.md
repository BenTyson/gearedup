methodology: |
  <p>We traveled with each bag to evaluate real-world performance:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access speed:</strong> How quickly can you get to your camera?</li>
    <li><strong>Protection:</strong> How well does padding protect gear?</li>
    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> How does it feel after hours of walking?</li>
    <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Can you find what you need easily?</li>
    <li><strong>Discretion:</strong> Does it scream "expensive camera inside"?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each bag on multi-day trips with various gear configurations.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "Backpack, sling, or messenger bag?"
    answer: "Backpacks carry the most and distribute weight best for long days. Slings offer quick access for minimal gear. Messenger bags look professional but strain one shoulder. For travel with substantial gear, backpacks win. For casual outings with one camera, slings are ideal."

  - question: "How do I choose the right size?"
    answer: "Think about your typical kit, not your entire collection. A body with 2-3 lenses fits in 15-20L. Add more lenses, flash, or drone and you need 25-30L. Bigger isn't always better - a half-empty large bag wastes space and lets gear shift around."

  - question: "Do camera bags attract thieves?"
    answer: "Yes, bags that obviously contain expensive cameras can be targets. This is why bags like Peak Design that look like regular backpacks are popular with travelers. In risky areas, many photographers use non-camera bags with inserted padded dividers."

  - question: "Is weather sealing important?"
    answer: "Very helpful if you shoot in rain or dusty conditions. Most quality bags are water-resistant; some include rain covers for heavy downpours. If you shoot in challenging weather often, prioritize weather protection. For fair-weather shooting, it's less critical."

  - question: "Can I use my camera bag as a carry-on?"
    answer: "Most camera backpacks fit under seats or in overhead bins. Check your bag's dimensions against airline requirements. Camera gear should always go in carry-on luggage, never checked bags - both for protection and because checked bags get lost."

Your camera bag has two jobs: protect your gear and get out of your way. A good bag lets you grab your camera quickly. A bad bag makes you stop, unzip, dig, and miss the shot.

For travel, you also need comfort for long days and enough room for non-camera essentials.

**Quick answer:** The [Peak Design Everyday Backpack](#product-1) is the benchmark at $280. The side access is a game-changer - you grab your camera without putting the bag down.
