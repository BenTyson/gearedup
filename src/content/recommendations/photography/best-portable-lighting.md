  <p>We tested lights in real shooting scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Output:</strong> How much usable light at practical distances?</li>
    <li><strong>Color accuracy:</strong> How true are skin tones?</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Size, weight, and battery life</li>
    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> How many situations can it handle?</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> How quickly can you adjust settings?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We shot portraits, products, and video with each light.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "LED continuous light vs flash - which should I start with?"
    answer: "LED is easier to learn because what you see is what you get. Flash is more powerful but requires understanding how exposure and flash interact. For video and learning lighting, start with LED. For events and portraits where you need power, learn flash."

  - question: "How bright does a portable light need to be?"
    answer: "It depends on distance and ambient light. Small LED panels (like Aputure MC) work great at arm's length for fill. For larger subjects or competing with sun, you need bigger lights (300+ lumens) or flash. Most pocket lights are accent/fill, not key lights."

  - question: "What color temperature should I look for?"
    answer: "Bi-color (adjustable 3200K-5600K) is most versatile - match any ambient light. Daylight-only (5600K) is fine for outdoors or mixed with window light. RGB adds creative color options but isn't essential. Accurate, adjustable white light matters most."

  - question: "Do I need a light stand for portable lights?"
    answer: "Small LED panels often have magnetic backs or small tripod threads - they can attach to almost anything. For more control, a compact light stand helps. Many photographers use small Gorillapods or magic arms to position portable lights."

  - question: "Can I use multiple small lights instead of one big light?"
    answer: "Yes! Multiple small lights give you more control over shadows and ratio. Two Aputure MCs can create a complete mini lighting setup. Start with one, add more as you learn. Multiple small lights are also more portable than one large one."

Light is everything in photography. Natural light is free but uncontrollable. Portable lights give you control anywhere - fill in shadows, add catchlights, or completely overpower ambient light.

The explosion of LED technology means powerful lights now fit in your pocket.

**Quick answer:** The [Aputure MC](#product-1) is our top pick at $90. Full RGB color, magnetic mount, and app control in a pocket-sized package. It's the Swiss Army knife of portable lighting.
