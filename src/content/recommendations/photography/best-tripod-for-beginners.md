methodology: |
  <p>We tested tripods in real shooting conditions across multiple scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stability:</strong> How well does it handle wind and vibration?</li>
    <li><strong>Build quality:</strong> Are the legs and joints solid?</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> How quickly can you set up and adjust?</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Weight and folded size for transport</li>
    <li><strong>Head quality:</strong> Smooth movement and secure locking</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We used each tripod with both mirrorless and DSLR cameras in various conditions.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How much should I spend on my first tripod?"
    answer: "Budget $100-200 for a tripod you won't immediately outgrow. Cheaper tripods ($30-50) work but are frustrating - flimsy, slow to adjust, and unstable. That frustration makes you leave the tripod home, which defeats the purpose. A decent tripod lasts years."

  - question: "What's the difference between aluminum and carbon fiber?"
    answer: "Carbon fiber is lighter and absorbs vibration better but costs 2-3x more. Aluminum is heavier but equally stable. For beginners, aluminum is the smart choice - spend the savings on a better head. Upgrade to carbon fiber later if the weight matters."

  - question: "What height tripod do I need?"
    answer: "Get a tripod that reaches eye level without extending the center column. Extending the center column reduces stability. For most people, a tripod with a maximum height of 60-65 inches (with column retracted) is ideal."

  - question: "Do I need a separate tripod head?"
    answer: "Budget tripods include a head. Mid-range and up often sell legs and heads separately. The head matters as much as the legs - a good ball head or pan-tilt head makes adjustments faster and more precise. Many photographers upgrade the head first."

  - question: "Travel tripod vs full-size - which should I get first?"
    answer: "Full-size if you mostly shoot locally. Travel tripods sacrifice stability and height for portability. A good full-size tripod is more versatile. Get a travel tripod as a second tripod when you actually need the portability."
