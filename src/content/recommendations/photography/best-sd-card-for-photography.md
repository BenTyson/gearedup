methodology: |
  <p>We tested cards in real cameras with actual shooting to evaluate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Write speed:</strong> How quickly does the buffer clear?</li>
    <li><strong>Burst depth:</strong> How many continuous shots before slowing?</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Any failed writes or corrupted files?</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer speed:</strong> How fast to copy to computer?</li>
    <li><strong>Value:</strong> Speed and capacity for the price</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We shot thousands of images and hours of video on each card.</p>

faqs:
  - question: "How much storage do I need?"
    answer: "64GB is minimum for casual shooters. 128GB is the sweet spot for most photographers - enough for a full day of shooting RAW. Go larger (256GB+) if you shoot video or don't want to offload often. Multiple smaller cards are safer than one huge card if a card fails."

  - question: "Does card speed matter for photos?"
    answer: "Yes, for burst shooting. Faster cards clear the buffer quicker, so you can keep shooting. For single shots or casual use, speed matters less. Sports, wildlife, and event photographers benefit most from fast cards."

  - question: "UHS-I vs UHS-II - what's the difference?"
    answer: "UHS-II cards have a second row of pins and can transfer at 300+ MB/s vs 104 MB/s for UHS-I. You need a UHS-II compatible camera and reader to benefit. For 4K video and high-speed bursts, UHS-II is worth it. For stills shooting, UHS-I is usually fine."

  - question: "Should I buy one big card or multiple smaller ones?"
    answer: "Multiple cards is safer. If a card fails or gets lost, you lose fewer photos. Professional photographers often swap cards throughout the day. That said, fewer cards means fewer things to lose and manage. Balance convenience with risk tolerance."

  - question: "How do I know if an SD card is fake?"
    answer: "Buy from reputable sellers (Amazon direct, B&H, Adorama). Fakes are common on marketplace listings and eBay. Test cards with free software like H2testw to verify actual capacity. If a deal seems too good, it probably is."
